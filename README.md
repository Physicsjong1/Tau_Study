# Tau_Study

Tau identification study with NanoAOD using RDataFrame of ROOT.
Currently, 2018 datasets are used.

Tau is identified with tag and probe method.
The interest point is one tau lepton decays to muon and the other decays to hadronic in the process of Z boson decays to two tau leptons.
Asymmetric gaussian fitting is applied.
